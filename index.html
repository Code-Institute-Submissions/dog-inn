                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p>I have a special bond with dogs that made me decide to bind my whole life with them. <br>
                    In 2017, I started working as a petsitter, giving my pupils the opportunity to stay in peace under a
                    careful eye during the trips of their owners. <br>
                    In 2019 i obtained the higher certificate in dog behavior and psychology. <br>
                    During these few years, various animals have been hosted under my roof. Many dogs grew up under my
                    care. Every time i try to make each of them feel at home. Fascinated by my pupils, I decided to help
                    their owners in their everyday problems by teaching them how to communicate with their sweets.
                    Starting with providing practical knowledge about raising and building a bond with a puppy, by
                    learning basic obedience skills using the clicker method, and ending with solving problem behaviors.
                    <br>
                    In our hotel, we create a family atmosphere, so the dogs entrusted to us can spend an unforgettable
                    time while their owners are away.
