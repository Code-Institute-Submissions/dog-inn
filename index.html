            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>I Have A Special Bond With Dogs That Made Me Decide To Tie My Whole Life With Them. In 2017, I Started
                Working As A Petsitter, Giving My Pupils The Opportunity To Stay In Peace Under A Careful Eye During The
                Trips Of Their Owners. In 2019 I Obtained The Higher Certificate In Dog Behavior And Psychology. During
                These Few Years, Various Animals Have Been Hosted Under My Roof. Many Dogs Grew Up Under My Care. Every
                Time I Try To Make Each Of Them Feel At Home. Fascinated By My Pupils, I Decided To Help Their Owners In
                Their Everyday Problems By Teaching Them How To Communicate With Their Sweets. Starting With Providing
                Practical Knowledge About Raising And Building A Bond With A Puppy; By Learning Basic Obedience Skills
                Using The Clicker Method, And Ending With Solving Problem Behaviors.</p>
